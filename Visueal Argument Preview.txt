In this preview I am showing a rough idea of my vision for this assignment. Like I discussed in my proposal, I want my visual argument to resemble the Weather app on Apple products. I worked with the gradient feature on GIMP to design a figure that resembles the sun the Weather app displays on sunny days. I plan to add a snowflake graphic above the temperature for February 9, 2003, a cloud graphic above the temperature for February 9, 2013, and a sun graphic above the temperature for February 9, 2023. I also want to add some form of contrast or figure to differentiate the temperature each year. I was planning to add a white vertical line between each year’s information, but I am open to other suggestions. Maybe I should make the lines another color, like yellow, to bring in some more contrast? I plan to add a banner at the bottom half of the design that resembles the warning/hazard alert. I will use the transparency tool to make the banner recognizable as the Apple alert. Within the banner I will urge people to take climate change seriously and give a quick overview of how the climate will be affected if we do not act now. However, I want to be cautious not to fill the banner with too many words. I want the temperature change for each year to carry the weight of my argument. I want to make the background of my image more textured, but am still working to learn GIMP’s features. I may experiment with layering an image from one of the resources Dr. Miller suggested. If anyone recommends a certain site for background editing, I would love to hear about it. I also want to experiment with typefaces. Luckily the default font on GIMP is similar to the font on the Weather app, but I think I can find something more exact.
